# Multi-Agent Ollama Assistant Configuration

# Router configuration - decides which agent handles each request
router:
  model: "gemma2:2b"  # Fast, lightweight model for routing decisions
  temperature: 0.3     # Lower temperature for consistent routing

# Specialized agents configuration
# Model selection strategy:
#   - gemma3:1b: Simple tasks, drafting, casual conversation
#   - gemma2:2b: Medium complexity tasks, general work
#   - gemma3:4b: Complex tasks requiring deeper reasoning

agents:
  # General conversation agent - simple, lightweight
  general:
    model: "gemma3:1b"
    description: "General conversation, simple questions, and casual chat"
    temperature: 0.7
    tools: []

  # File management agent - medium complexity
  file_manager:
    model: "gemma2:2b"
    description: "File operations, saving documents, reading files, managing directories"
    temperature: 0.3
    tools:
      - read_file
      - write_file
      - list_directory
      - create_directory
      - delete_file

  # Calendar management agent - medium complexity
  calendar:
    model: "gemma2:2b"
    description: "Calendar management, scheduling events, checking availability"
    temperature: 0.3
    tools:
      - create_event
      - list_events
      - delete_event

  # Web search agent - medium complexity
  web_search:
    model: "gemma2:2b"
    description: "Internet search, current information, web queries, news"
    temperature: 0.5
    tools:
      - web_search
      - fetch_url

  # Document analysis agent - complex task requiring deeper analysis
  document_analyst:
    model: "gemma3:4b"
    description: "Document reading, analysis, summarization, extracting information from PDFs/DOCX"
    temperature: 0.4
    tools:
      - read_file
      - analyze_document
      - extract_text

  # Code helper agent - complex task requiring technical reasoning
  code_helper:
    model: "gemma3:4b"
    description: "Code writing, debugging, technical questions, running Python scripts"
    temperature: 0.6
    tools:
      - read_file
      - write_file
      - execute_code

# You can customize:
# - Add more agents
# - Change models (e.g., llama3.2:3b, phi3:mini)
# - Adjust temperatures (lower = more focused, higher = more creative)
# - Assign different tools to agents
# - Modify agent descriptions to refine routing
